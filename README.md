### Notes
The main challenge was making the API call to the movie db since I forgot to add the "s" in "https". Additionally, creating the movie view controller cocoa touch class was bugging out so that cost me a little extra time. All in all, I'm happy with the turnout of this app and learned a lot! I'm especially happy with the view constraints I added in to make sure it works with all devices.
